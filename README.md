<h1>MACHINE LEARNING ARDUINO</h1>

It is a library which can be implemented in an ARDUINO<br />
You can train your neuralnetwork with your computer with the Machine learning algorithm<br />
You can find in src or in my other repository in my github<br />
<h3>Train your neural network</h3>

You train your neural network on your computer, it's the first step<br/>


<h3>Extract the neural network</h3>

When you have finished your training, you will be able to launch the command<br/>
<code> ~$ ./extract_nn ./model/brain.ml</code><br/>
It will extract all the information in a line, you will just paste in your arduino editor<br />

<h3>Implementation on arduino</h3>

Once you have done the previous step, you have to import the library m_learning for arduino in the folder arduino.<br/>
And after that you will be able to use your neural network on your arduino !
